                     draft-iab-covid19-workshop-00

Abstract

   The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet traffic,
   particularly during the introduction of the initial quarantine and
   work-from-home arrangements.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
   Impacts of the pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.  The meeting was
   held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at
   that time.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss
   Network Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.
   The meeting was held online given the on-going travel and contact
   restrictions at that time.

Internet-Draft  IAB COVID-19 Network Impacts Workshop 20    January 2021


   COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic.  These changes
   appeared rather abruptly, in particular during the introduction of
   the initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.  The changes
   relate to traffic volumes, location of traffic, as well as the types
   of traffic and applications used.

   Announcement for the workshop was sent out in July 2020, requesting
   interested parties to submit position papers for the workshop program
   committee.  A total of 15 position papers were received from
   altogether 33 authors.  The papers are listed in Section 4.  In
   addition, several other types of contributions and pointers to
   existing work were provided.  A number of position papers referred to
   parallel work being published in measurement-related academic
   conferences.

   Invitations for the workshop were sent out based on the position
   papers and other expressions of interest.  On the workshop conference
   calls were 45 participants, listed in Section 5.

   The workshop was held over one week hosting three sessions covering
   measuremnets and observations, operational issue, and final future
   consideration and conclusions.  As these three session were scheduled
   Monday, Wednesday, and Friday a positive side effect was that the
   time in between could be used foor mailing list discusion and
   compilation of additional workshop material.

2.  Scope

   The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people's lives
   and the societies and economies around the globe.  But it also had
   big impact on networking.  With large numbers of people working from
   home or otherwise depending on the network for their daily lives,
   network traffic has surged.  Internet service providers and operators
   have reported 20% traffic growth or more in a matter of weeks.
   Traffic in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) is similarly on the rise.
   Most forms of network traffic have seen an increase, with
   conversational multimedia traffic growing in some cases more than
   200%. And user time spent on conferencing services has risen by an
   order of magnitude on some conferencing platforms.

   In general, the Internet has coped relatively well with this traffic
   growth, albeit not without some issues.  For instance, some outages,
   video quality reduction, and other issues were reported.
   Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how the technology, operators
   and service providers have been able to respond to large changes in
   traffic patterns.

   Understanding what actually happened with Internet traffic is of
   course interesting by its own right.  How that impacted user
   experience, or the intended function of the services is equally
   interesting.  Measurements and reports of traffic situation from 2020
   are therefore valuable.  But it would also be interesting to
   understand what types of network management and capacity expansion
   actions were taken in general.  Anecdotal evidence points to Internet
   and service providers tracking how their services are used, and in
   many cases adjusting services to accommodate the new traffic
   patterns, from dynamic allocation of compute resources to more
   complex changes.

   The impacts of this crisis are also a potential opportunity to
   understand the impact of traffic shifts and growth more generally, or
   to prepare for future situations -- crisis or otherwise - that impact
   networking.  Or even allow us to adjust the technology to be even
   better suited to respond to changes.

   The workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network
   operators, and network management experts, and Internet technologists
   to share their experiences.  The scope included:

   *  measurements about traffic changes, user experience, service
      performance, and other relevant aspects

   *  discussion about the behind the scenes network management and
      expansion activities

   *  experiences in the fields of general Internet connectivity,
      conferencing, media/entertainment, and Internet infrastructure

   *  lessons learned for preparedness and operations

   *  lessons learned for Internet technology and architecture

3.  Discussion Topics

3.1.  Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

   The workshop started with a focus on measurements.  A larger portion
   of the submitted papers presented and discussed measurement data and
   these submissions provided a good basis get a better understanding of
   the situation, covering different angles and aspects of network
   traffic and kind of networks.

3.1.1.  Overall traffic growth

   Based on the measuremenst data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan
   educational network, and a mobile operator it was observed at the
   beginning of the workshop that overall the network was able to handle
   the situation well despite an significant increase in traffic growth
   rate in March/April.

3.1.2.  Changes in traffic patterns

   Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased
   and traffic from home network increased.  Strong increase in video
   conferencing (incl remote schooling)

3.1.2.1.  Example campus network

   TBD...

3.1.2.2.  Example mobile networks

   TBD...

3.1.3.  A deeper look at interconnections

   Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly
   by adding new capacity (earlier?)

3.1.4.  CDN networks

3.1.5.  Last mile congestion

   Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE)

3.1.6.  User Behaviour

   The type of traffic needed by the users also changed in 2020.
   Upstream traffic increased due the use of video conferences, remote
   schooling, and similar applications.  The NCTA and Comcast reported
   that while downstream traffic grew 20%, upstream traffic grew as much
   as 30% to 37% [NCTA2020] [Comcast2020].  Vodafone reported that
   upstream traffic grew 100% in some markets [Vodafone2020].

   Ericsson's Consumer Lab surveyed users for their usage and
   experiences during the crisis).  Some of the key findings in
   [ConsumerlabReport2020] were:

   *  9 in 10 users increased Internet activities, and time spent
      connected increased.  In addition, 1 in 5 started new online
      activities, many in the older generation felt that they were
      helped by video calling, parents felt that their children's
      education was helped, and so on.

   *  Network performance was in general found satisfactory. 6 in 10
      were very satisfied with fixed broadband, and 3 in 4 felt that
      mobile broadband was same or better as before the crisis.
      Consumers valued resilience and quality of service as the most
      important task for network operators.

   *  Smartphone application usage changed, with fastest growth was in
      COVID-19, remote working, e-learning, wellness, education, remote
      health consulation, and social shared experience applications.
      Biggest decreases were in travel and booking, ride hailing,
      location, and parking applications.

   Some of the behaviours are likely permanent changes
   [ConsumerlabReport2020].  The adoption of video calls and other new
   services by many consumers, such as the older generation, is likely
   going to have a long-lasting effect.  Surveys in various
   organizations point to a likely long-term increase in the number of
   people interested in remote work [WorkplaceAnalytics2020]
   [McKinsey2020].

3.3.  Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future

3.4.  Conclusions
