       Report from the IAB COVID-19 Network Impacts Workshop 2020
                   draft-iab-covid19-workshop-latest

Abstract

   The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet traffic,
   particularly during the introduction of the initial quarantine and
   work-from-home arrangements.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
   Impacts of the pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.  The meeting was
   held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at
   that time.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
   Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020.  The
   meeting was held online given the on-going travel and contact
   restrictions at that time.

   COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic.  These changes
   appeared rather abruptly, in particular during the introduction of
   the initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.  The changes
   relate to traffic volumes, location of traffic, as well as the types
   of traffic and applications used.

   A total of 15 position papers were received from 33 authors, listed
   in Section 3.  In addition, several other types of contributions and
   pointers to existing work were provided.  On the workshop conference
   calls were 45 participants, listed in Section 4.

2.  Topic and Scope

2.1.  Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

   Significant increase in traffic growth rate in March/April

   Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased
   and traffic from home network increased.  Strong increase in video
   conferencing (incl remote schooling)

   Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly
   by adding new capacity (earlier?)

   Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE)

2.1.1.  Overall traffic growth

   TBD...

2.1.2.  Changes in traffic patterns

   TBD...

2.1.2.1.  Example campus network

   TBD...

2.1.2.2.  Example mobile networks

   TBD...

2.1.3.  A deeper look at interconnections

   TBD...

2.1.4.  Last mile congestion

   TBD...

2.1.5.  User Behaviour

   TBD...
