Internet-Draft  IAB COVID-19 Network Impacts Workshop 20    January 2021


   COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic.  These changes
   appeared rather abruptly, in particular during the introduction of
   the initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements.  The changes
   relate to traffic volumes, location of traffic, as well as the types
   of traffic and applications used.

   Announcement for the workshop was sent out in July 2020, requesting
   interested parties to submit position papers for the workshop program
   committee.  A total of 15 position papers were received from
   altogether 33 authors.  The papers are listed in Section 4.  In
   addition, several other types of contributions and pointers to
   existing work were provided.  A number of position papers referred to
   parallel work being published in measurement-related academic
   conferences.

   Invitations for the workshop were sent out based on the position
   papers and other expressions of interest.  On the workshop conference
   calls were 45 participants, listed in Section 5.

   The workshop was held over one week hosting three sessions covering
   measuremnets and observations, operational issue, and final future
   consideration and conclusions.  As these three session were scheduled
   Monday, Wednesday, and Friday a positive side effect was that the
   time in between could be used foor mailing list discusion and
   compilation of additional workshop material.

2.  Scope

   The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people's lives
   and the societies and economies around the globe.  But it also had
   big impact on networking.  With large numbers of people working from
   home or otherwise depending on the network for their daily lives,
   network traffic has surged.  Internet service providers and operators
   have reported 20% traffic growth or more in a matter of weeks.
   Traffic in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) is similarly on the rise.
   Most forms of network traffic have seen an increase, with
   conversational multimedia traffic growing in some cases more than
   200%. And user time spent on conferencing services has risen by an
   order of magnitude on some conferencing platforms.

   In general, the Internet has coped relatively well with this traffic
   growth, albeit not without some issues.  For instance, some outages,
   video quality reduction, and other issues were reported.
   Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how the technology, operators
   and service providers have been able to respond to large changes in
   traffic patterns.

   Understanding what actually happened with Internet traffic is of
   course interesting by its own right.  How that impacted user
   experience, or the intended function of the services is equally
   interesting.  Measurements and reports of traffic situation from 2020
   are therefore valuable.  But it would also be interesting to
   understand what types of network management and capacity expansion
   actions were taken in general.  Anecdotal evidence points to Internet
   and service providers tracking how their services are used, and in
   many cases adjusting services to accommodate the new traffic
   patterns, from dynamic allocation of compute resources to more
   complex changes.

   The impacts of this crisis are also a potential opportunity to
   understand the impact of traffic shifts and growth more generally, or
   to prepare for future situations -- crisis or otherwise - that impact
   networking.  Or even allow us to adjust the technology to be even
   better suited to respond to changes.

   The workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network
   operators, and network management experts, and Internet technologists
   to share their experiences.  The scope included:

   *  measurements about traffic changes, user experience, service
      performance, and other relevant aspects

   *  discussion about the behind the scenes network management and
      expansion activities

   *  experiences in the fields of general Internet connectivity,
      conferencing, media/entertainment, and Internet infrastructure

   *  lessons learned for preparedness and operations

   *  lessons learned for Internet technology and architecture

3.  Discussion Topics

3.1.  Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

   The workshop started with a focus on measurements.  A larger portion
   of the submitted papers presented and discussed measurement data and
   these submissions provided a good basis get a better understanding of
   the situation, covering different angles and aspects of network
   traffic and kind of networks.

3.1.1.  Overall traffic growth

   Based on the measuremenst data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan
   educational network, and a mobile operator it was observed at the
   beginning of the workshop that overall the network was able to handle
   the situation well despite an significant increase in traffic growth
   rate in March/April.

3.1.2.  Changes in traffic patterns

   Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased
   and traffic from home network increased.  Strong increase in video
   conferencing (incl remote schooling)

3.1.2.1.  Example campus network

   Changes in traffic have been observed at University campus networks
   as well, especially due to the forced adoption of remote teaching.
   The Politecnico di Torino University (Italy) deployed its in-house
   solution for remote teaching, which caused the outgoing traffic to
   grow by 2.5 times, driven by more than 600 daily online classes.
   Incoming traffic, instead, decreased by a factor of 10 due to the
   stop of any in-presence activity.  Based on their measurements, this
   change in traffic and network usage did however not lead to noticable
   performance impairments, nor significantly poor performance have been
   observed for students in remote regions of Italy.  Further ,outgoing
   traffic increased as well due to remote working solutions such as
   collaboration platforms, VPNs and remote desktop.

3.1.2.2.  Example mobile networks

   TBD...

3.1.3.  A deeper look at interconnections

   Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly
   by adding new capacity (earlier?)

3.1.4.  Cloud platforms

   Cloud infrastructure plays a prominent role in supporting bandwidth
   demanding video conferencing and remote learning tools to practice
   social distancing in COVID-19 pandemic.  Network congestion between
   cloud platforms and access networks could impact on the quality of
   experience of these cloud-based applications.  CAIDA leveraged web-
   based speed test servers to perform download and upload throughput
   measurements from virtual machines in public cloud platforms to
   various access ISPs in the United States [Mok2020].

Internet-Draft  IAB COVID-19 Network Impacts Workshop 20    January 2021


   The key findings included: * Persistent congestion events were not
   widely observed between cloud platforms and these networks,
   particular for large-scale ISPs, but we could observe large diurnal
   download throughput variations in peak hours from some locations to
   the cloud. * There is evidence of persistent congestion in the egress
   direction to regional ISPs serving suburban areas in the U.S.  Their
   users could suffer from poor video streaming or file download
   performance from the cloud. * The macroscopic analysis over 3 months
   (June-August, 2020) revealed downward trends in download throughput
   from ISPs and educational networks to certain cloud regions.  We
   believed that increased use of the cloud in the pandemic could be one
   of the factors that contributed to the decreased performance.

3.1.5.  Last mile congestion

   Last-mile is the centerpiece of broadband connectivity, poor last-
   mile performance generally translates to poor quality of experience.
   In a recent IMC'20 research paper Fontugne et al. investigated last-
   mile latency using traceroute data from RIPE Atlas probes located in
   646 ASes and looked for recurrent performance degradation
   [Fontugne2020-1].  They found that in normal times Atlas probes in
   only 10% ASes experience persistent last-mile congestion but they
   recorded 55% more congested ASes during the COVID-19 outbreak.  This
   deterioration caused by stay-at-home measures is particularly marked
   in large eyeball networks and certain parts of the world.  They found
   Japan to be the most impacted country in their study looking
   specifically at NTT OCN, but noting similar observations for several
   Japanese networks, including IIJ (AS2497).

   From mid-2020 onwards, they however observe better performances than
   before the pandemic.  In Japan, this is partly due to the deployments
   originally planned for accommodating the Tokyo Olympics, and more
   generally, it reflects the efforts of network operators to cope with
   these exceptional circumstances.  The pandemic has demonstrated that
   its adaptive design and proficient community can keep the Internet
   operational during such unprecedented events.  Also, from the
   numerous research and operational reports recently published, the
   pandemic is apparently shaping a more resilient Internet, as
   Nietzsche wrote, "What does not kill me makes me stronger".

3.1.6.  User Behaviour

   The type of traffic needed by the users also changed in 2020.
   Upstream traffic increased due the use of video conferences, remote
   schooling, and similar applications.  The NCTA and Comcast reported
   that while downstream traffic grew 20%, upstream traffic grew as much
   as 30% to 37% [NCTA2020] [Comcast2020].  Vodafone reported that
   upstream traffic grew 100% in some markets [Vodafone2020].

   Ericsson's Consumer Lab surveyed users for their usage and
   experiences during the crisis).  Some of the key findings in
   [ConsumerlabReport2020] were:

   *  9 in 10 users increased Internet activities, and time spent
      connected increased.  In addition, 1 in 5 started new online
      activities, many in the older generation felt that they were
      helped by video calling, parents felt that their children's
      education was helped, and so on.

   *  Network performance was in general found satisfactory. 6 in 10
      were very satisfied with fixed broadband, and 3 in 4 felt that
      mobile broadband was same or better as before the crisis.
      Consumers valued resilience and quality of service as the most
      important task for network operators.

   *  Smartphone application usage changed, with fastest growth was in
      COVID-19, remote working, e-learning, wellness, education, remote
      health consulation, and social shared experience applications.
      Biggest decreases were in travel and booking, ride hailing,
      location, and parking applications.

   Some of the behaviours are likely permanent changes
   [ConsumerlabReport2020].  The adoption of video calls and other new
   services by many consumers, such as the older generation, is likely
   going to have a long-lasting effect.  Surveys in various
   organizations point to a likely long-term increase in the number of
   people interested in remote work [WorkplaceAnalytics2020]
   [McKinsey2020].

3.2.  Operational Practices and Changes

   TBD...

3.3.  Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future

   TBD...

3.4.  Conclusions

   There is a wealth of data about the performance of the Internet
   during the criss.  The main conclusion from the various measurements
   is that fairly large shifts occurred.  And those shifts were not
   merely about changing one application for another, they actually
   impacted traffic flows and directions, and caused in many cases a
   significant traffic increase.  Early reports also seem to indicate
   that the shifts have went relatively smoothly from the point of view
   overall consumer experience.

   An important but not so visible factor that lead to this was that
   many people and organizations where highly motivated to ensure good
   experience.  A lot of collaboration happened in the background,
   problems were corrected, many providers significantly increased their
   capacity, and so on.

   In general, the Internet also seems inherently well suited for
   adapting to a new situation, at least within some bounds.  The
   Internet is designed for any application and situation, rather than
   optimized for today's particular traffic.  This makes it possible to
   use it for many applications, in many deployment situations, and make
   changes as needed.  The generality is present in many parts of the
   overall system, from basic Internet technology to browsers, from name
   servers to content delivery networks and cloud platforms.  When needs
   change, what is needed is often merely different services, perhaps
   some re-allocation of resources, but not fundamental technology or
   hardware changes.

   On the other hand, this is not to say that no improvements are
   needed:

   *  Better understanding of the health of the Internet: Going forward,
      the critical nature that Internet plays in our lives means that
      the health of the Internet needs to receive significant attention.
      Understanding how well networks work is not just a technical
      matter, it is also of crucial importance to the people and economy
      of the societies using it.  Projects and research that monitor
      Internet and services performance in a broad scale and across
      different networks are therefore important.

   *  The pandemic has shown how the effects of the digital divide can
      be amplified during a crisis.  More attention is needed to ensure
      that broadband is available to all, and that Internet services
      equally serve different groups.

   *  We need to continue work on all the other improvements that are
      seen necessary anyway, such as further improvements in security,
      ability for networks and applications to collaborate better, etc.

   *  Informal collaboration between different parties needs to continue
      and be strengthened.
