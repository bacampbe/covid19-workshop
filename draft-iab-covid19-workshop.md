# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss Network
Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020. The meeting
was held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at that time.

COVID-19  has  caused  changes  in  Internet  traffic.  These  changes
appeared rather abruptly, in particular during the introduction of the
initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements. The changes relate
to  traffic volumes,  location of  traffic, as  well as  the types  of
traffic and applications used.

Announcement for the workshop was sent out in July 2020, requesting
interested parties to submit position papers for the workshop program
committee.  A total of 15 position papers were received from
altogether 33 authors. The papers are listed in {{positionpapers}}.
In addition, several other types of contributions and pointers to
existing work were provided. A number of position papers referred to
parallel work being published in measurement-related academic
conferences.

Invitations for the workshop were sent out based on the position
papers and other expressions of interest. On the workshop conference calls were 45
participants, listed in {{participants}}.

The workshop was held over one week hosting three sessions covering
measuremnets and observations, operational issue, and final future consideration
and conclusions. As these three session were scheduled Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
a positive side effect was that the time in between could be used foor mailing
list discusion and compilation of additional workshop material.

# Topics and Scope {#topicandscope}

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people’s lives
and the societies and economies around the globe. But it also had big
impact on networking. With large numbers of people working from home
or otherwise depending on the network for their daily lives, network
traffic has surged. Internet service providers and operators have
reported 20% traffic growth or more in a matter of weeks. Traffic in
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) is similarly on the rise. Most forms
of network traffic have seen an increase, with conversational
multimedia traffic growing in some cases more than 200%. And user time
spent on conferencing services has risen by an order of magnitude on
some conferencing platforms.

In general, the Internet has coped relatively well with this traffic
growth, albeit not without some issues. For instance, some outages,
video quality reduction, and other issues were reported. Nevertheless,
it is interesting to see how the technology, operators and service
providers have been able to respond to large changes in traffic
patterns.

Understanding what actually happened with Internet traffic is of
course interesting by its own right. How that impacted user
experience, or the intended function of the services is equally
interesting. Measurements and reports of traffic situation from 2020
are therefore valuable. But it would also be interesting to understand
what types of network management and capacity expansion actions were
taken in general. Anecdotal evidence points to Internet and service
providers tracking how their services are used, and in many cases
adjusting services to accommodate the new traffic patterns, from
dynamic allocation of compute resources to more complex changes.

The impacts of this crisis are also a potential opportunity to
understand the impact of traffic shifts and growth more generally, or
to prepare for future situations — crisis or otherwise – that impact
networking. Or even allow us to adjust the technology to be even
better suited to respond to changes.

The workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network
operators, and network management experts, and Internet technologists
to share their experiences. The scope included:

* measurements about traffic changes, user experience, service performance, and other relevant aspects
* discussion about the behind the scenes network management and expansion activities
* experiences in the fields of general Internet connectivity, conferencing, media/entertainment, and Internet infrastructure
* lessons learned for preparedness and operations
* lessons learned for Internet technology and architecture

## Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics {#measurement}

The workshop started with a focus on measurements. A larger portion of the submitted
papers presented and discussed measurement data and these submissions provided a good 
basis get a better understanding of the situation, covering different angles and
aspects of network traffic and kind of networks.

### Overall traffic growth

Based on the measuremenst data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan educational network,
and a mobile operator it was observed at the beginning of the workshop that overall the 
network was able to handle the situation well despite an significant increase in traffic
growth rate in March/April.

### Changes in traffic patterns

Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased and traffic from home network increased. Strong increase in video conferencing (incl remote schooling)

#### Example campus network

TBD... 

#### Example mobile networks

TBD... 

### A deeper look at interconnections

Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly by adding new capacity (earlier?)

### CDN networks

### Last mile congestion

Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE) 

### User Behaviour

The COVID-19 impact on networking was not merely about amount of
traffic. The type of traffic also changed. For instance, massive
increases were reported in the use of teleconferencing, e-learning,
and other similar tools.

Upstream traffic has increased due the use of video conferences,
remote schooling, and similar applications. The NCTA and Comcast
reported that while downstream traffic grew 20%, upstream traffic grew
as much as 30% to 37% {{NCTA2020}} {{Comcast2020}}. Vodafone reported that
upstream traffic grew 100% in some markets {{Vodafone2020}}.

Ericsson's Consumer Lab surveyed users for their usage and experiences
during the crisis). Some of the key findings in {{ConsumerlabReport2020}} were:

* 9 in 10 users increased Internet activities. Time spent connected
  increased, by 2.5 hours for fixed broadband and 1 hour for mobile
  broadband. In addition, 1 in 5 started new activities such as
  e-learning or video-conferencing. Three quarters of the older
  generation felt that they were helped by video calling with family
  and friends. Three in four parents felt that their children's
  education was helped by ICT technology.

* Network performance was in general found satisfactory. 6 in 10 were
  very satisfied with fixed broadband, and 3 in 4 felt that mobile
  broadband was same or better as before the crisis.

* Smartphone application usage changed, with fastest growth was in
  COVID-19, remote working, e-learning, wellness, education, remote
  health consulation, and social shared experience
  applications. Biggest decreases were seen (unsurprisingly) in travel
  and booking, ride hailing, location, and parking applications.

* Among many different service provider actions, maintaining network
  resilience and quality of service was deemed as the most important
  activity (64% saw this as very important and 34% as somewhat
  important).

One interesting result of the changes is that some of the behaviours
are likely permanent changes. According to {{ConsumerlabReport2020}} 6 in
10 working people in US wants to switch to video-based conferences,
even after the crisis has passed. And 4 in 10 students in US plan to
continue taking online courses. The adoption of video calls and other
new services by many consumers, such as the older generation, is also
likely going to have a long-lasting effect.

Similarly, anecdotal evidence and local surveys in various
organizations point to a likely long-term increase in the number of
people interested in remote work in their work arrangements
