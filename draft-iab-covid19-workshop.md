# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss Network
Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020. The meeting
was held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at that time.

COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic. These changes
appeared rather abruptly and were significant, in particular during the introduction of the
initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements. The changes relate
to traffic volumes, location of traffic, as well as the types of
traffic and applications used.

Announcement for the workshop was sent out in July 2020, requesting
interested parties to submit position papers for the workshop program
committee. A total of 15 position papers were received from
altogether 33 authors. The papers are listed in {{positionpapers}}.
In addition, several other types of contributions and pointers to
existing work were provided. A number of position papers referred to
parallel work being published in measurement-related academic
conferences.

Invitations for the workshop were sent out based on the position
papers and other expressions of interest. On the workshop conference calls were 45
participants, listed in {{participants}}.

The workshop was held over one week hosting three sessions covering
measurements and observations, operational issue, and final future consideration
and conclusions. As these three sessions were scheduled Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
a positive side effect was that the time in between could be used for mailing
list discussion and compilation of additional workshop material.

# Scope {#scope}

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people’s lives
and the societies and economies around the globe. But it also had big
impact on networking. With large numbers of people working from home
or otherwise depending on the network for their daily lives, network
traffic has surged. Internet service providers and operators have
reported 20% traffic growth or more in a matter of weeks. Traffic in
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) is similarly on the rise. Most forms
of network traffic have seen an increase, with conversational
multimedia traffic growing in some cases more than 200%. And user time
spent on conferencing services has risen by an order of magnitude on
some conferencing platforms.

In general, the Internet has coped relatively well with this traffic
growth, albeit not without some issues. For instance, some outages,
video quality reduction, and other issues were reported. Nevertheless,
it is interesting to see how the technology, operators and service
providers have been able to respond to large changes in traffic
patterns.

Understanding what actually happened with Internet traffic is of
course interesting by its own right. How that impacted user
experience, or the intended function of the services is equally
interesting. Measurements and reports of traffic situation from 2020
are therefore valuable. But it would also be interesting to understand
what types of network management and capacity expansion actions were
taken in general. Anecdotal evidence points to Internet and service
providers tracking how their services are used, and in many cases
adjusting services to accommodate the new traffic patterns, from
dynamic allocation of compute resources to more complex changes.

The impacts of this crisis are also a potential opportunity to
understand the impact of traffic shifts and growth more generally, or
to prepare for future situations — crisis or otherwise – that impact
networking. Or even allow us to adjust the technology to be even
better suited to respond to changes.

The workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network
operators, and network management experts, and Internet technologists
to share their experiences. The scope included:

* measurements about traffic changes, user experience, service performance, and other relevant aspects
* discussion about the behind the scenes network management and expansion activities
* experiences in the fields of general Internet connectivity, conferencing, media/entertainment, and Internet infrastructure
* lessons learned for preparedness and operations
* lessons learned for Internet technology and architecture

# Discussion Topics {#discussion}

## Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics {#measurement}

The workshop started with a focus on measurements. A larger portion of the submitted
papers presented and discussed measurement data and these submissions provided a good
basis get a better understanding of the situation, covering different angles and
aspects of network traffic and kind of networks.

### Overall traffic growth

Based on the measurement data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan educational network,
and a mobile operator it was observed at the beginning of the workshop that overall the
network was able to handle the situation well despite a significant and sudden increase in traffic
growth rate in March/April. In many regions the traffic growth expected in a typical year took 
place in the matter of a few weeks. In access networks, the growth rate of upstream traffic also 
exceeded the growth in downstream traffic, reflecting increased adoption and use of video 
conferencing and other remote work and school applications. 

### Changes in traffic patterns

At a high level, the traffic in mobile network decreased as a result of reduced population mobility while traffic from home network 
increased. As a result of the shift for working and learning at home, there was a strong increase in video conferencing and remote 
learning application traffic. The typical diurnal usage patters in network also changed, with peak times occuring earlier in the day 
and peak times lasting longer over the day - once again reflecting the start of the work or school day from home. 

#### Example campus network

Changes in traffic have been observed at University campus networks as well, especially due to the necessary adoption of remote teaching. The Politecnico di Torino University (Italy) deployed its in-house solution for remote teaching, which caused the outgoing traffic to grow by 2.5 times, driven by more than 600 daily online classes. Incoming traffic, instead, decreased by a factor of 10 due to the stop of any in-presence activity. Based on their measurements, this change in traffic and network usage did however not lead to noticeable performance impairments, nor significantly poor performance have been observed for students in remote regions of Italy. Further, outgoing traffic increased as well due to remote working solutions such as collaboration platforms, VPNs and remote desktop.

#### Example mobile networks

Mobile network data usage appeared to decline following the imposition of localized lockdown measures, as these reduced typical levels of mobility and roaming. 

### A deeper look at interconnections

Traffic at points of network interconnection noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly by rapidly adding additional capacity. The 
amount of increases varied, with some networks that hosted popular applications such as video conferencing experiencing traffic growth of 
several hundred to several thousand percent. 

### Cloud platforms

Cloud infrastructure played a key role in supporting bandwidth-intensive video conferencing and remote learning tools to practice social distancing in COVID-19 pandemic. Network congestion between cloud platforms and access networks could impact on the quality of experience of these cloud-based applications. CAIDA leveraged web-based speed test servers to perform download and upload throughput measurements from virtual machines in public cloud platforms to various access ISPs in the United States {{Mok2020}}.

The key findings included:
* Persistent congestion events were not widely observed between cloud platforms and these networks, particular for large-scale ISPs, but we could observe large diurnal download throughput variations in peak hours from some locations to the cloud.
* There is evidence of persistent congestion in the egress direction to regional ISPs serving suburban areas in the U.S. Their users could suffer from poor video streaming or file download performance from the cloud.
* The macroscopic analysis over 3 months (June-August, 2020) revealed downward trends in download throughput from ISPs and educational networks to certain cloud regions. We believed that increased use of the cloud in the pandemic could be one of the factors that contributed to the decreased performance.

### Last mile congestion

Last-mile access networks are the centerpiece of broadband connectivity. In a recent IMC'20 research paper Fontugne et al. investigated last-mile latency using traceroute data from RIPE Atlas probes located in 646 ASes and looked for recurrent performance degradation {{Fontugne2020-1}}. They found that in normal times Atlas probes in only 10% ASes experience persistent last-mile congestion (as defined by ....) but they recorded 55% more congested ASes during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. This deterioration caused by stay-at-home measures is particularly marked in large eyeball networks and certain parts of the world and was not a universal degradation; performance in some regions was good while it suffered in others. In particular, they found Japan to be the most impacted country in their study looking specifically at NTT OCN, but noting similar observations for several Japanese networks, including IIJ (AS2497). Why some countries performed better than others may be due to both technical and non-technical reasons and may merit further study.

But these degradations, in limited regions where they occured, appeared short-lived as network operators rapidly responded to COVID-19 by adding new capacity. From mid-2020 onwards, they however observe better performance than before the pandemic. In Japan, this is partly due to the deployments originally planned for accommodating the Tokyo Olympics, and more generally, it reflects the efforts of network operators to cope with these exceptional circumstances. The pandemic has demonstrated that its adaptive design and proficient community can keep the Internet operational during such unprecedented events. Also, from the numerous research and operational reports recently published, the pandemic is apparently shaping a more resilient Internet, as Nietzsche wrote, “What does not kill me makes me stronger”.

Finally, many of the most heavily used applications during COVID-19 use Internet protocols that are by design adaptive to changes in network conditions. So even those limited areas of congestion, either in the last mile or elsewhere on the end-to-end path, these applications adapted to 
changing conditions such that users could continue to functionally use those applications and may not have even noticed some of the underlying network issues. 

### Home network performance

### User behaviour

The type of traffic needed by the users also changed in 2020. Upstream
traffic increased due the use of video conferences, remote schooling,
and similar applications. The NCTA and Comcast reported that while
downstream traffic grew 20%, upstream traffic grew as much as 30% to
37% {{NCTA2020}} {{Comcast2020}}. Vodafone reported that upstream
traffic grew 100% in some markets {{Vodafone2020}}.

Ericsson's Consumer Lab surveyed users for their usage and experiences
during the crisis). Some of the key findings in {{ConsumerlabReport2020}} were:

* 9 in 10 users increased Internet activities, and time spent
  connected increased. In addition, 1 in 5 started new online
  activities, many in the older generation felt that they were helped
  by video calling, parents felt that their children's education was
  helped, and so on.

* Network performance was in general found satisfactory. 6 in 10 were
  very satisfied with fixed broadband, and 3 in 4 felt that mobile
  broadband was same or better as before the crisis.  Consumers valued
  resilience and quality of service as the most important task for
  network operators.

* Smartphone application usage changed, with fastest growth was in
  COVID-19, remote working, e-learning, wellness, education, remote
  health consultation, and social shared experience
  applications. Biggest decreases were in travel
  and booking, ride hailing, location, and parking applications.

Some of the behaviours are likely permanent changes
{{ConsumerlabReport2020}}. The adoption of video calls and other new
services by many consumers, such as the older generation, is likely
going to have a long-lasting effect.  Surveys in various organizations
point to a likely long-term increase in the number of people
interested in remote work {{WorkplaceAnalytics2020}} {{McKinsey2020}}.

## Operational Practices and Changes {#operational}

Networks added significant capacity in record time in response to the onset of the pandemic. This demonstrated the operationl value of maintaining sufficient excess capacity to handle not just failures but sudden and unexpected events as this. 

## Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future {#architecture}

In the face of the sudden and dramatic changes in Internet usage, companies across the Internet ecosystem scrambled to react quickly to add network, server, application and other capacity. This worked well in large part because of the loosely coupled and decentralized design of the Internet; each of these actors could work completely independently without the delay that would otherwise be inherent in centralized operating and decision-making models. In essence, at each layer of the protocol stack various actors were rapidly innovating and adding capacity - another demonstration of why the layered, loosely coupled, decentralized Internet has been so successful. It was also clear how very important for the incredible variety of end user connectivity and device performance that key applications were designed to be constantly adaptive to changing network conditions. 

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

There is a wealth of data about the performance of the Internet during
the crises. The main conclusion from the various measurements is that
fairly large shifts occurred. And those shifts were not merely about
changing one application for another, they actually impacted traffic
flows and directions, and caused in many cases a significant traffic
increase. Early reports also seem to indicate that the shifts have
went relatively smoothly from the point of view overall consumer
experience.

An important but not so visible factor that led to this was that
many people and organizations where highly motivated to ensure good
experience. A lot of collaboration happened in the background,
problems were corrected, many providers significantly increased their
capacity, and so on.

In general, the Internet also seems inherently well suited for
adapting to a new situation, at least within some bounds.  The
Internet is designed for any application and situation, rather than
optimized for today's particular traffic. This makes it possible to
use it for many applications, in many deployment situations, and make
changes as needed. The generality is present in many parts of the
overall system, from basic Internet technology to browsers, from name
servers to content delivery networks and cloud platforms. When needs
change, what is needed is often merely different services, perhaps
some re-allocation of resources, but not fundamental technology or
hardware changes.

On the other hand, this is not to say that no improvements are needed:

* Better understanding of the health of the Internet: Going forward,
  the critical nature that Internet plays in our lives means that the
  health of the Internet needs to receive significant
  attention. Understanding how well networks work is not just a
  technical matter, it is also of crucial importance to the people and
  economy of the societies using it. Projects and research that
  monitor Internet and services performance in a broad scale and
  across different networks are therefore important.

* The pandemic has shown how the effects of the digital divide can be
  amplified during a crisis. More attention is needed to ensure that
  broadband is available to all, and that Internet services equally
  serve different groups.

* We need to continue work on all the other improvements that are seen
  necessary anyway, such as further improvements in security, ability
  for networks and applications to collaborate better, etc.

* Informal collaboration between different parties needs to continue
  and be strengthened.
