# Introduction



# Topic and Scope

## Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

Significant increase in traffic growth rate in March/April

Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased and traffic from home network increased. Strong increase in video conferencing (incl remote schooling)

Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly by adding new capacity (earlier?)

Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE) 

### Overall traffic growth

### Changes in traffic patterns

#### Example campus network

#### Example mobile networks

### A deeper look at interconnections

### Last mile congestion


## Operational Practices and Changes

## Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future
