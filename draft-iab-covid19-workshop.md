The COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in Internet traffic,
particularly during the introduction of the initial quarantine and
work-from-home arrangements.

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
Impacts of the pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020. The meeting
was held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at that time.

# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a work to discuss Network
Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020. The meeting
was held online given the on-going travel and contact restrictions at that time.

COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic. These
changes appeared rather abruptly, in particular during the
introduction of the initial quarantine and work-from-home
arrangements. The changes relate to traffic volumes, location of
traffic, as well as the types of traffic and applications used.

A total of 15 position papers were received from 33 authors, listed in
{{#positionpapers}}.  In addition, several other types of
contributions and pointers to existing work were provided. On the
workshop conference calls were 45 participants, listed in
{{#participants}}.

# Topic and Scope

## Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics

Significant increase in traffic growth rate in March/April

Changes in the traffic patterns: Traffic in mobile network decreased and traffic from home network increased. Strong increase in video conferencing (incl remote schooling)

Network load noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly by adding new capacity (earlier?)

Last mile congestion/higher latency on legacy network (PPPoE) 

### Overall traffic growth

TBD... 

### Changes in traffic patterns

TBD... 

#### Example campus network

TBD... 

#### Example mobile networks

TBD... 

### A deeper look at interconnections

TBD... 

### Last mile congestion

TBD... 

### User Behaviour

TBD...

## Operational Practices and Changes

TBD... 

## Architectural Consideration and Conclusion for Future

## Conclusions
